- Connecto is a result of the stress took upon me while sharing my Pre-Saved Notes or Document File to my Client or Multiple Clients.
- Uptil now, I use save my regulars in Google Keep Notes and in future if I need to send those notes or Doucument to any clients where I have to navigate out of my  messenger application and goto my Google Keep Note, Long-Press my particular note and then goto share to my Platform, After that I am able to share my info.
